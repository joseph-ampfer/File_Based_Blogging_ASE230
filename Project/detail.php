    'content' => 'Web development has become an essential skill in today’s digital world. Whether you are building a personal website or a large-scale business platform, this guide covers all the key aspects of modern web development including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and more.',
    'full-content' => "Web development is a constantly evolving field that blends creativity, technology, and problem-solving. With the rise of the internet and digital platforms, having a solid understanding of web development is invaluable, whether you are a business owner, a designer, or a budding developer. This comprehensive guide will walk you through the fundamentals of web development, from the basics of HTML and CSS to advanced JavaScript frameworks and modern development practices.

1. Understanding Web Development Basics
Web development is generally divided into two main categories: Front-End Development and Back-End Development.

Front-End Development: This is everything a user sees and interacts with on a website. It includes the design, layout, and overall user experience. Key technologies used in front-end development are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Back-End Development: This refers to the server-side of web development. It involves databases, servers, APIs, and everything that powers the front end. Back-end development is often done using languages like Python, Ruby, PHP, Node.js, and frameworks such as Django, Flask, and Express.js.

2. Core Technologies for Web Development
To build a modern website, you need to master a few core technologies:

HTML (HyperText Markup Language): HTML is the backbone of any web page. It defines the structure and content of a web page. Understanding HTML is the first step in becoming a web developer.

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): CSS is used to style and layout web pages. With CSS, you can control the color, font, spacing, and overall layout of the web page, making it more visually appealing.

<p>React is a JavaScript library used for building user interfaces, particularly for single-page applications where you need a dynamic and interactive experience. Unlike other libraries or frameworks, React is focused on the view layer only, which makes it easy to integrate with other libraries and frameworks.</p>

<h3>Why Use React?</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Component-Based Architecture</strong>: React encourages building UIs using small, reusable components, which leads to more maintainable and scalable code.</li>
  <li><strong>Virtual DOM</strong>: React uses a virtual DOM to efficiently update the user interface. It minimizes the number of direct manipulations to the real DOM, which can be slow and performance-heavy.</li>
  <li><strong>One-Way Data Binding</strong>: React’s unidirectional data flow ensures that changes in the state propagate predictably, making debugging and development easier.</li>
  <li><strong>Strong Ecosystem and Community Support</strong>: With a massive community, robust documentation, and a wealth of third-party libraries and tools, React has an ecosystem that is hard to beat.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Getting Started: Setting Up Your React Environment</h2>
<p>To start building with React, you'll need a development environment set up. You can create a new React application using <strong>Create React App</strong>, a command-line tool that sets up everything you need to get started:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Install Node.js and npm</strong>: Ensure that Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) are installed on your machine. They are required to run React applications.</li>
  <li><strong>Create a New React App</strong>: Run the following commands in your terminal to set up a new React project:</li>
</ol>

<pre><code>npx create-react-app my-first-react-app
cd my-first-react-app
npm start
</code></pre>

<p>This will start a development server and open your new React app in the browser.</p>",
